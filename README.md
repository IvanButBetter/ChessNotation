# ChessNotation
Aiming to teach chess notation in a fast and simple way. Project for Web Design 1 at my school.


This website does not a lot of generating and more of teaching.

Todo: <br>
•Improve image quality <br>
•Merge website into a larger website <br>
•Remove notation from inside images, switch to seperate text box <br>
•Make home send to main website when it exists <br>
•Add a generator eventually
For school faculty: <br>
This website is made wholly by me. If you believe that the assignment I submitted is stolen from this git repo, you are wrong.
